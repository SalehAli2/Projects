# 📦 Supply Chain Analysis: Make vs Buy

## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on **supply chain decision-making** — specifically, deciding whether a product should be **manufactured in-house (Make)** or **purchased from suppliers (Buy)**.  

The analysis is built around four key factors:
- **Value**
- **Quality**
- **Costs**
- **Time**

Dashboards were developed to support data-driven decision-making and provide insights into supplier selection, cost structures, and scenario-based analysis.

## 📊 Dashboards

### 1️⃣ Supplier Selection Dashboard
Helps evaluate and select the best supplier based on **lowest full cost**.

**Features:**
- 🔍 **Slicer** to filter by product and volume  
- 📊 **Stacked Bar Chart** → Cost breakdown (Extended Cost + Non-Recurring Expenses)  
- 📋 **Table** including:  
  - Supplier Part Number  
  - Volume  
  - Sum of On-Time Cost  
  - Unit Cost  
  - Full Cost  
- 📈 **Line Charts**:  
  - Unit cost by volume & supplier  
  - Non-recurring expenses by volume & supplier  

---

### 2️⃣ Scenario Analysis Dashboard
Enables **scenario-based supplier analysis** to determine the **lowest full cost supplier** as **volume changes**.

---

### 3️⃣ Make vs Buy Dashboard
Compares the cost implications of making in-house versus buying from suppliers.

**Features:**
- Comparison of **Full Cost by Supplier & Part**  
- **Decision indicator**: Make or Buy  
- Calculation of **Cost Avoidance / Savings**  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Used
- **Power BI** for dashboarding and visualizations  
- **Data Analysis** for supplier evaluation  
- **Scenario Analysis** for what-if cost modeling  
- **Decision Analytics** for Make vs Buy strategies  

---

## 🚀 Key Outcomes
- Identified lowest-cost suppliers under different volume scenarios  
- Visualized cost structures including **recurring & non-recurring expenses**  
- Supported strategic **Make vs Buy** decisions  
- Highlighted potential **cost avoidance / savings** opportunities
